Final Project
========

<img height="350" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ut-cs378-vision-2014fall/course-info/master/images/sfm_header.png"/>

For your final project, you'll tackle a problem related to 3D reconstruction and computer vision. This will include:

* A detailed proposal of the problem you plan to solve.
* Two progress reports on your implementation.
* A final report detailing your approach and results.
* A ten-minute in-class presentation of your results.

### Project proposal (20 points), Due 28 Oct, 11:59pm

It is up to each group to select a project topic. You'll present your idea in a project proposal, which I'll evaluate to make sure that it has appropriate scope, difficulty, and to help get you started researching how to accomplish your implementation.

As we covered various topics related to 3D reconstruction and computer vision this semester, I've tried to highlight particular problems and applications that seemed like good candidates for final projects. Look over the course meeting notes to remind yourself of what we've covered so far and to motivate your selection of a topic. That said, you need not limit yourself to things we've explicitly covered in class meetings.

The first step of your project will be to submit a project proposal including:

* Members of your group and group name
* Project topic
* Objectives with associated measurable results
* Planned schedule for meeting objectives

#### Groups

You are free to self-organize into any group you like as long as it has at least three and no more than five members. List your group members and any filename-safe team name you like (used for managing code and submissions) in your proposal. I expect larger groups to take on more ambitious projects.

#### Topic requirements

Although you have a lot of latitude in the topic of your project, it must meet at least the following requirements:

* It has some component where 3D information is deduced from 2D images.
* It demands substantial implementation effort on your part (i.e., original code creation).
* It has a reasonable probability of success given the time and resources available to you.

Aim high! It is better to be too ambitious and fail to meet some of your goals than to select too simple of a project. I will take into account the difficulty of the project when evaluating it.

#### Objectives and associated results

Given the topic you plan to approach, determine at least three high-level objectives that you are aiming for. For each objective, identify at least one measureable result that confirms whether and to what extent you have met the objective. Here are some example objectives and associated results:

* Objective: Reconstruct a room with my cell phone camera
  * Result: A phone app that tracks 100 or more 3D points accurately in real-time.
  * Result: A 3D point cloud which measures major dimensions of the room with in 10% of true dimensions.

* Objective: Insert an image on the football field of a UT home game.
  * Result: A still image of the field with 99% of foreground pixels removed.
  * Result: A 5-second gameplay clip including a pan where the playing field bounds are estimated to within 10% accuracy.

* Objective: Control a mouse cursor by tracking a hand in a cell phone video.
  * Result: Succesfully segment a hand from 90% of video frames with a clean background.
  * Result: Send an email entirely using the system.

#### Planned schedule for meeting objectives

For each result you listed, estimate the effort required to complete it, and the date on which you expect to have achieved that result. The more detailed you make your results, the easier this estimation will be, and the better chance you'll have of finishing your project on schedule.

If you like, you can assign particular objectives and/or results to specific group members--whatever works best for you.

#### How to turn in

By the due date, place a file `proposal.pdf` in the `project_4` repository of your group members.

### Progress Report 1 (10 points), Due 13 Nov, 11:59pm
Progress Report 1 is an updated and expanded version of your initial proposal. It should include:
* Updated Project topic
* Updated objectives with associated measurable results
* Updated schedule for meeting objectives

Each group should have recieved an evaluation of their initial proposal by 4 November. Using this evaluation, update your topic, objectives, and schedule as necessary, and include it in your progress report.

Further, for any results or objectives that you planned to achieve by the Progress Report 1 due date, demonstrate that you have achieved them by providing images, video, or starter code. If you missed your planned completion date, explain what challenges you faced that prevented you from achieving them.

Include an updated schedule in your progress report that reflects what you believe you can achieve and when for the duration of the final project schedule.

#### How to turn in.

By the due date, place a file `progress_report_1.pdf' in the `project_4' repository of your group members.

### Progress Report 2 (10 points), Due 20 Nov, 11:59pm
Requirements are the same as for progress report 1, except you should address the goals for the time period between progress report 1 and 2.

#### How to turn in.

By the due date, place a file `progress_report_2.pdf` in the `project_4' repository of your group members.

### Final report and implementation (50 points), Due 2 Dec, 11:59pm
Details to come.

### In-class presentation (10 points), 25 Nov, 2 Dec, or 4 Dec
Details to come.

## Logistics

You will work on this project in self-selected groups of three to five students.

If the group chooses to turn in a project N days late, each individual in the group will lose N of their remaining late days for the semester. If one or more students have no more late days left, they'll lose credit without affecting the other group members' grades.
