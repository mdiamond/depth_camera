### In order to run our program:
Run 'python stereo\_camera.py'

### This will create:
* A point cloud called 'point\_cloud.ply' in the current directory.
* A disparity map called 'disparity.jpg' in the test\_data directory.

If you would like to re-calibrate the cameras, run 'python calibrator.py'

All of the videos/images are located on the 'test\_data' directory
